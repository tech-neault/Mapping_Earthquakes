# Mapping Earthquakes
### Visualizing the movements of the Earth's tectonic plates with GeoJSON data

## Purpose
The purpose of this map is to display global earthquake activity, including comparative magnitudes on the Richter scale, for the past 7 days. To do this, we used GeoJSON data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

## Maps
On these maps, one can view different map views (satellite, dark, or street) in addition to viewing all global Earthquake activity and the outlines of the tectonic plates. 

## Future Expansion
In the future, this map could also house data on global volanic activity. As volcanos usually (but not always) occur near tectonic plates, adding this data could increase our awareness of natural occurrences.
